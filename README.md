# SpaCEX: A self-supervised learning on spatially co-expressed genes in spatial transcriptomics data
We develop the **SpaCEX** which utilize self-supervised learning on **Spa**tially *C*o-**EX**pressed genes that can simultaneously identify spatially co-expressed genes and learn semantically meaningful gene embeddings from SRT data through a pretext task of gene clustering. **SpaCEX** first employs an image encoder to transform the spatial expression maps of genes into gene embeddings modeled by a Studentâ€™s t mixture distribution (SMM). Subsequently, a discriminatively boosted gene clustering algorithm is applied on the posterior soft assignments of genes to the mixture components, iteratively adapting the parameters of the encoder and the SMM.
